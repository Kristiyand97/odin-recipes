<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature indicated on the lasagna noodle package instructions.</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, but make sure to slightly undercook them, as they will continue cooking in the oven. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet or pan, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat. Break it up into small pieces as it cooks. Once it's cooked through, remove any excess grease from the pan.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the cooked meat. Saut√© until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
    <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and tomato paste. Stir well to combine. Add dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasonings according to your preference. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with a handful of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
    <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the ricotta.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layering process with the meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese. You can create as many layers as you desire, typically three layers are common.</li>
    <li>For the final layer, spread the remaining meat sauce on top of the lasagna noodles. Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it is tightly sealed. This will help retain moisture during baking.</li>
    <li>Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake according to the lasagna noodle package instructions or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
