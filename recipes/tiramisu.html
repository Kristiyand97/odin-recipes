<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its luscious layers of creamy goodness and delicate coffee flavor. This delectable dessert has gained popularity worldwide for its irresistible combination of textures and flavors.</p>
<h3>Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rum or coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
    <li>24 ladyfingers</li>
    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together until thick and pale yellow.</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until just simmering. Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously.</li>
    <li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This will take about 5 minutes. Do not let it boil.</li>
    <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the custard mixture cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>In a separate mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, whisk the mascarpone cheese until smooth. Then, fold in the cooled custard mixture and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li>Gently fold in the whipped cream until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a shallow dish, combine the cooled brewed coffee and rum or coffee liqueur (if using). Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture briefly, allowing it to soak up some of the liquid, but not becoming overly saturated</li>
    <li>Arrange half of the soaked ladyfingers in a single layer in the bottom of a rectangular or square glass dish.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers with the remaining soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone cream.</li>
    <li>Sift a generous amount of unsweetened cocoa powder over the top layer of the tiramisu to cover it completely.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. Chilling allows the flavors to meld and the tiramisu to set.</li>
    <li>Just before serving, you can optionally garnish the top with a dusting of cocoa powder or grated chocolate.</li>
    <li>Slice and serve the delicious tiramisu, enjoying the layers of creamy goodness and delicate coffee flavor.</li>
